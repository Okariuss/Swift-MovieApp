## Features

- **Trending Movies:** The app displays a list of the top trending movies, showcasing popular and highly-rated films.
- **Movie Details:** Users can view detailed information about each movie, including the title, description, release date, and average rating.
- **Movie Images:** High-quality images associated with each movie are loaded and displayed using the SDWebImage library.
- **Pagination:** The app supports pagination, allowing users to load more movies as they scroll through the list.
- **Responsive UI:** The user interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

The MovieApp is built using the following technologies:

- **Swift:** The programming language used to develop the iOS application.
- **UIKit Framework:** The iOS framework that provides the core components and functionalities for building the user interface.
- **SDWebImage:** An open-source library that simplifies the process of loading and caching remote images in iOS apps.
- **TMDb API:** The TMDb API (The Movie Database API) is used to fetch movie data, including details and images, to populate the app with up-to-date information.
